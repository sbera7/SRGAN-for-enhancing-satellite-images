# SRGAN for enhancing satellite images
This repository contains the implementation of enhancing satellite images using Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN).
## Overview
Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) is a deep learning model that generates high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. This technique is particularly useful in satellite image processing where enhancing image quality is crucial for various applications such as remote sensing, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.
The methodology implemented in this repository is based on the following paper:
